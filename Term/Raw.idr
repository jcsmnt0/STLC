-- d is the (maximum) depth of the syntax tree, which provides functions that recurse over this structure with an
-- argument that decreases monotonically in size as they recurse down, which makes the termination checker happy;
-- this comes up most often when trying to use a partially-applied recursive call as a function argument to e.g. map.
-- some constructors add more than 1 to the depth because the corresponding Scoped.Term and/or Typed.Term value is
-- actually a compound term that involves multiple constructors, and the scopechecking and typechecking operations
-- output a term with the same depth as their input argument, but that's probably avoidable.
